# VueSpa

This project was generated with [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) version 3.0.0 
and the default web api MVC template for .NET Core 2.1 

## Development

Run `npm start` for a dev client app server.
Run `dotnet run` for the dotnet'.
Navigate to `https://localhost:5001`.
The downside of this template is that in development mode you have to run the npm instance in the console 
This is a work in progress, but I'm trying to solve the problem of using the proxy while in development.

## Publish

Run `dotnet publish` to publish the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1` directory.
